# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
You aim to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment using a supervised learning approach.

Step 1: Problem Statement
You aim to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment using a supervised learning approach.

Step 2: Dataset
For this project, you can use the IMDb movie reviews dataset available in the nltk library. It contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

Step 3: Libraries Required
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

nltk for natural language processing tasks
scikit-learn for machine learning models
numpy and pandas for data manipulation and numerical operations

Step 4: Data Loading and Exploration
Description:
movie_reviews.fileids() loads the dataset.
movie_reviews.raw(fileid) fetches the content of each review.
data.head() displays the first few rows of the dataset.
data['sentiment'].value_counts() counts the number of positive and negative reviews.

Step 5: Data Preprocessing
Description:
CountVectorizer() converts text data into numerical feature vectors.
train_test_split() splits data into training and testing sets.

Step 6: Model Training and Evaluation
Description:
MultinomialNB() initializes the Naive Bayes classifier.
model.fit() trains the model using the training data.
model.predict() makes predictions on the test data.
accuracy_score() computes the accuracy of the model.
classification_report() provides a detailed classification report including precision, recall, and F1-score.

Step 7: Results Interpretation
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted reviews.
Classification Report: Provides a breakdown of performance metrics for each class (positive and negative 

Step 8: Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of text classification using a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. Further improvements could involve using more advanced techniques like TF-IDF vectorization, experimenting with different classifiers, or handling imbalanced datasets.

Algorithms Used
Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

Details for Understanding
Data Loading: Fetching and organizing text data from the IMDb movie reviews dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Converting text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training a classifier, making predictions, and evaluating performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding text classification tasks and applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.
